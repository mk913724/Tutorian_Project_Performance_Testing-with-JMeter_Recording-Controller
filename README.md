# **Performance Testing Project: Tutorian Web Application**

This repository contains detailed **performance testing artifacts** for the **Tutorian web application**, demonstrating end-to-end performance evaluation using **Apache JMeter**. The project includes well-structured **test plans, performance test cases, bug reports, and execution summary reports**, covering real-world performance statuses such as **Pass, Failed, and Warning** under different load conditions.

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on **performance testing of key public pages** of the Tutorian platform, including Home, Courses, Blog, Exams, Community, and Policy pages. The goal is to evaluate **response time, stability, and behavior under load** by simulating real user navigation using **JMeter Recording Controller**.

The project also tracks **performance defects** identified during test execution and classifies them by severity and priority to help improve application reliability and user experience.

## **Features Tested**

* Home Page response time under normal load
* Course listing page performance
* Free Classes page stability
* Blog and Community page response consistency
* Exams page load performance
* Contact page accessibility
* Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and Refund Policy page performance
* Sequential and recorded user flow testing
* Warning and failure detection based on response thresholds

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **Apache JMeter** – Performance and load testing
* **HTTP/HTTPS Protocol** – Request handling
* **Recording Controller** – Real user navigation simulation
* **GitHub** – Version control and documentation
